I am a Ph.D. student in the University of Hong Kong under the supervision of Prof. Wenping Wang. Before starting my PhD, I obtained a Bachelor's Degree in the Department of Control Science and Engineering in Zhejiang University in 2014. My research interests include depth estimation, 3D reconstructions, etc.
